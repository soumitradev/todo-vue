# vue_todo

This is an alternative frontend for my other project, [todo-node](https://github.com/soumitradev/todo-node), that was a full stack todo-list project.

This is my first Vue.js project and it was built in a short span, so it doesn't have complete functionality like:
- Viewing all public todos, and
- Viewing docs for the API

But for now, this will do as a bit of practice.

Vue is fun.
